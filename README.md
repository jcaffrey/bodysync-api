##  Bodysync Backend API

#### HSA DEV


We relied heavily on Sequelize for Express [docs](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/1.7.0/articles/express/) to set things up.


Starting up the api with some dummy data from `/bodysync/backend/`: 


```
$ # in one shell, start db
$ brew install mysql
$ brew services start mysql # start daemon 
$ mysql -uroot # connect client (depends on your machine's mysql config)
mysql> source ~/Desktop/hsadev/bodysync/backend/config/dev-db-script.sql # will create the db bodysync, has to be an abs path

$ # in some other shell, start app
$ npm install
$ npm start # will sync tables w/ sequelize

mysql> # back in the connected client
mysql> source ~/Desktop/hsadev/bodysync/backend/config/dev-db-dump.sql # will create some dummy data to view on the front end

```
